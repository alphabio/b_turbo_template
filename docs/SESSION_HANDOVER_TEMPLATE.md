## ⚠️ Guidelines for Next Session

**DO:**

- ✅ Read previous session folder if more context needed
- ✅ Check git-ref.txt to see code state
- ✅ Verify build/tests before starting

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Copy previous session content here
- ❌ Include full debugging transcripts (create artifact doc)
- ❌ Paste code snippets (link to files or commit)
- ❌ Write more than ~200 lines (extract to artifact docs)

**Remember:** This is a snapshot of THIS session. Artifacts archive with session folder.

## 🗂️ File Naming Conventions

**Temporary files (`/tmp/`):**
- Always prefix with `b_` (e.g., `/tmp/b_analysis.md`, `/tmp/b_script.sh`)
- Helps user identify agent-generated files
- User may review later for valuable context

**Session artifacts:**
- Descriptive names: `BUG_ADVECTION.md`, `PERFORMANCE_FIX.md`
- All caps for visibility (optional but common)
- Clear purpose in filename
