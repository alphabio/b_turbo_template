# 📚 Documentation Guide

**Purpose:** Entry point for agents and developers working on this turborepo monorepo template.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start for New Agents

1. **Read this file** to understand the monorepo structure
2. **Check `SESSION_HANDOVER.md`** for current project state
3. **Review `WORKFLOW_QUICKREF.md`** for session workflow
4. **Review `CODE_QUALITY.md`** for standards and conventions
5. **Begin work** - confirm action plan with user

## 📝 Session Handover Protocol

### Philosophy

**Keep it lean:** Each session handover documents ONLY what happened in that session. Previous context is in archived sessions - don't duplicate it.

**Think incremental snapshots, not cumulative history.**

### For Incoming Agent (Starting Session)

1. **Read `SESSION_HANDOVER.md`** (current state)
2. **Get context:**
   - What's the current focus?
   - What's blocking?
   - What needs to happen next?
3. **Archive current handover:**

```bash
# Find next number
NEXT=$(ls -1 docs/sessions/SESSION_HANDOVER.*.md | wc -l | xargs)
NEXT=$((NEXT + 1))

# Move current to sessions
mv docs/SESSION_HANDOVER.md docs/sessions/SESSION_HANDOVER.$(printf "%03d" $NEXT).md
```

4. **Create new `SESSION_HANDOVER.md`:**

```bash
# Copy template
cp docs/SESSION_HANDOVER_TEMPLATE.md docs/SESSION_HANDOVER.md

# Or create from scratch
touch docs/SESSION_HANDOVER.md
```

**Use the template as a guide - see `docs/SESSION_HANDOVER_TEMPLATE.md`**

5. **Read `CODE_QUALITY.md`** (important)

6. **Begin work**

- Confirm action plan for this session / resolve any questions with user
- Ask if the user has anything additional to add

### For Outgoing Agent (Ending Session)

**Your job: Write a good handover for the next agent**

1. **Update `docs/SESSION_HANDOVER.md`** throughout your session

Include:

- What was accomplished
- Current state (what's working, what's not)
- Session artifacts created (list them)
- Next steps and blockers
- Key decisions made

2. **Create working docs as needed:**

```bash
# Create analysis docs, bug reports, etc. in docs root
docs/BUG_ADVECTION.md
docs/PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md
docs/CRITICAL_FINDINGS.md
```

Don't worry about organizing - next agent will archive them.

3. **Promote lasting docs if needed:**

If you create an ADR or something with lasting value:

```bash
# Move to architecture immediately
mv docs/ADR-001-state-management.md docs/architecture/decisions/
```

Or note in handover: "Promote `ADR-001-state-management.md` to architecture"

4. **Reference previous sessions if helpful:**

```markdown
## Related Context

See `docs/sessions/001/BUG_ADVECTION.md` for original bug analysis.
```

**The next agent will archive everything on session start.**

---

**Key principle:**

- Current handover: `docs/SESSION_HANDOVER.md` (you edit this)
- Archives: `docs/sessions/NNN/` (next agent creates on start)
- Work naturally, archive on transition

**Key principle:** `SESSION_HANDOVER.md` is always current. Old ones go to `sessions/` and become immutable.

---

## 🧹 Cleanup Instructions

During development, ad-hoc documents are often created in the project root or various locations.

### When to Clean Up

Periodically (or when instructed), organize loose documentation:

```bash
# Architecture decisions → docs/architecture/
mv ROOT_DOC_ABOUT_ARCHITECTURE.md docs/architecture/decisions/

# Planning docs that are complete → docs/archive/
mv PLANNING_DOC.md docs/archive/

# Outdated/deprecated → docs/archive/
mv OLD_APPROACH.md docs/archive/
```

### Guidelines

- **Architecture docs** → `docs/architecture/` (use subdirectories: decisions/, patterns/, diagrams/)
- **Completed plans** → `docs/archive/`
- **Old/deprecated** → `docs/archive/`
- **Feature specs** → Create `docs/features/` if needed for your project
- **Research notes** → Create `docs/research/` if needed for your project

**Keep root clean:** Only essential files (README.md, package.json, etc.) should live in project root.

---

## 🎯 Key Directories Explained

### `sessions/`

Archived session handovers. Immutable historical record of project progress and decisions. Each session gets numbered (001, 002, 003...) and archived at the start of the next session.

### `architecture/`

System design, architecture decisions (ADRs), technical choices, and patterns. Documents the "why" and "how" of the codebase structure. Create subdirectories for decisions, patterns, and diagrams as needed.

### `archive/`

Deprecated or superseded documentation. Kept for historical reference but no longer active. Move completed planning docs and old approaches here.

---

## 📖 Important Documents

**Current Session:**

- `SESSION_HANDOVER.md` - Start here for current state
- `WORKFLOW_QUICKREF.md` - Session workflow cheat sheet

**Standards:**

- `CODE_QUALITY.md` - Code standards and quality gates

**Architecture:**

- `architecture/README.md` - System architecture and decisions

---

## ⚠️ Important Conventions

### Documentation

- **`SESSION_HANDOVER.md` is always current** - Lives in `docs/` root, archived on session start
- **Old handovers go to `sessions/NNN/`** - Complete session folders with artifacts
- **This README stays static** - Minimal maintenance required
- **Link, don't duplicate** - Reference other docs instead of copying

### Temporary Files

- **Prefix with `b_`** - All temp files in `/tmp/` must start with `b_` (e.g., `/tmp/b_analysis.md`, `/tmp/b_script.sh`)
- **Why:** Easy to identify agent-generated files vs system files
- **Applies to:** Analysis docs, scratch files, ad-hoc scripts, working notes
- **User may review later** - Temp files often contain valuable context

Examples:

```bash
# ✅ Good
/tmp/b_session_flow_analysis.md
/tmp/b_build_script.sh
/tmp/b_debug_output.txt

# ❌ Bad
/tmp/analysis.md
/tmp/script.sh
/tmp/output.txt
```

### File Organization

- **Active docs in architecture/** - ADRs, patterns, technical decisions
- **Historical records in sessions/** - Project progress over time
- **Deprecated in archive/** - Historical reference only

### Naming

- Session handovers: `SESSION_HANDOVER.nnn.md` (zero-padded: 001, 002, 003)
- Architecture decisions: `NNN-kebab-case-title.md` in `architecture/decisions/`
- General docs: lowercase with hyphens `document-name.md`

## 🎯 Monorepo Concepts

### Workspaces

- **Apps (`apps/*`)**: Deployable applications, each can be independently developed and deployed
- **Packages (`packages/*`)**: Shared code used by apps and other packages
- **Workspace protocol**: `workspace:*` in package.json links to local packages

### Turborepo Features

- **Task pipelines**: Automatically run tasks in correct order based on dependencies
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching of build outputs for faster rebuilds
- **Parallel execution**: Run tasks across packages in parallel when possible
- **Remote caching**: Optional shared cache for teams (not enabled by default)

### Catalog (PNPM Feature)

- Centralized dependency version management in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- Use `catalog:` in package.json to reference catalog versions
- Ensures consistent versions across all packages
